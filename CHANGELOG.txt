v2.0.2
------
Release date: 05-03-2025

* Several corrections in TriangleMesh intersect, is_intersection_t and 
  is_intersection methods

* Transformations were not taken into account when using the plot method, 
  now it's corrected

* Addition of more tests


v2.0.1
------
Release date: 03-03-2025

* Correction of a bug occuring while using a version of numpy < 2.0.0
  - np.atan2 and np.acos replaced by np.arctan2 and np.arccos

* README image links updated

* Correct file format and add test files in MANIFEST file

* Ignore certain unwanted warnings


v2.0.0
------
Release date: 02-03-2025

This release includes some breaking changes like the input of TriangleMesh where
the variable names are different, but also the input (2d ndarray). Other breaks are
for example changes of certain method outputs.

* Acceleration of geometric calculations thanks to numpy multi-dimentional array operations
    - Point, Vector and Normal classes can now have 1-D ndarray x, y, z components
    - Functions in vecope.py have been adapted to allow Point, Vector and Normal
      with 1-D ndarray x, y, z components
    - Readaptation of the Ray and BBox classes with the new Point, Vector and Normal
      classes
    - BBox intersect method allow 1-D, 2-D and 2-D diagonal calculations
    - Readaptation of the quadric classes enabling intersection tests with a class
      Ray containing several rays
    - Readaptation of Triangle and TriangleMesh classes. Allow 1-D, 2-D and 2-D
      diagonal calculations
    - ...

* The 3D objects intersect output is now an xarray Dataset

* Several new functionalities
    - New method 'to_triangle_mesh' to convert a quadric to a TriangleMesh object
    - New method 'to_plot' for TriangleMesh, and also for all quadrics
    - New TriangleMesh method 'write' to save the triangle mesh in nectcdf4 and also in
    - several other formats as stl, ply, ...
    - The 'read_trianglemesh' function allows to read triangle mesh files (gcnc, stl, ply,
      etc.) and return a TriangleMesh object
    - ...

* A lot of tests have been added, more documentations, cleaning, ...


v1.2.2
------
Release date: 13-02-2025

* Correction of a bug in TriangleMesh constructor
    - The bug occurred when we set the vi parameter as a 2d array.

* Add tests detecting the corrected bug

* Add docstring to area method for all objects


v1.2.1
------
Release date: 13-02-2025

* Correction in vec2ang function
    - small correction in the docstring
    - correct a bug appearing when the parameter v is not a normalized vector
    - add the missing default value of the parameter vec_view

* Add tests enabling to detect the corrected bug


v1.2.0
------
Release date: 10-02-2025

* Add new functions
    - ang2vec
    - vec2and

* Add the Disk class
    - It can be a disk, a partial disk, an annulus or a partial annulus

* Add new method to all 3d objects "is_intersection_t"
    - the method is faster than intersect method, but gives only thit

* Move tests folder into geoclide folder
* And some improvements


v1.1.1
------
Release date: 07-02-2025

* Correction of a bug with the normal orientation at the intersection with a 3d object


v1.1.0
------
Release date: 05-02-2025

* Add the Spheroid class (oblate or prolate object)
* Small optimization of sphere intersection test


v1.0.0
------

Release date: 2025-01-27

First public release.
